# Bounded candidate compilation units

Owners: `examples/lexer_candidate/src/module_units.fy` and
`examples/lexer_candidate/src/module_ast_join.fy`.

The original single joined owner cannot hold the actual compiler source set:
the observed compacted dispatcher has 152020 expressions and 11509 entries.
Raising its numeric caps would also expand every downstream binding, HIR and
MIR arena. Compilation therefore needs several independently bounded owners.

The first implemented layer groups whole input modules in manifest order.
`module_units::build` measures the actual parser-owned arena counts and emits
maximal contiguous half-open module ranges. Every original module appears in
exactly one range, including unused user functions. No declaration, body,
source byte or token is removed to make a group fit. A module that cannot fit
by itself is rejected; function-level subdivision is not implemented here.

Every group retains the existing joined-owner caps: 512 declarations, 16384
expressions, 8192 statements, 1024 entries, 4096 types, 1024 fields, and 4096
attributes and attribute arguments. The entire input still has at most 256
files, at most 65536 bytes per file and at most 1048576 bytes including its
original separator newlines. Partitioning does not admit larger source sets.

`module_ast_join::join_range` borrows the full source vector and joins only one
nonempty range. It applies all existing join checks and remaps each selected
file's source spans, token IDs and arena references exactly as the full join
does. The returned owner starts at local source offset zero. Failures retain
the original full-vector module index, not the group's relative index. Invalid
ranges return code 9 before subtraction or indexing. The original `join` API
delegates to the full range and keeps its original limits and rejection behavior.

The plan is a grouping aid, not semantic or SDK authority. `joined` rechecks
the live sources through the range join; cached usage does not grant permission
to exceed a bound. Source-set signature validation and SDK authentication remain
with their existing owners. Separate groups can be joined sequentially without
copying a second vector of all parser owners or retaining all joined results.

The development probe authenticated and compacted the actual 160-file dispatcher
and joined all twelve groups. Each group's observed arena counts equal its
measured plan, and all original modules are covered once. The eight native tests
include a 1206-entry source set that the full join rejects but two bounded joins
retain exactly, source-byte preservation, original error coordinates, invalid
ranges, and the existing join/cooked-storage regressions. Evidence:
`docs/ops/evidence/candidate-module-units-20261009.json`.

This layer does not yet compile the groups. Cross-group calls, imported nominal
types, generic specialization, owned HIR/MIR identity, C symbols, final linking
and diagnostics must consume full-source coordinates while using local arenas.
The current CLI continues to use the single joined owner until those connections
are implemented; successful AST partitioning is not a full-dispatcher C result
or stage1/stage2 proof.

# Fairy candidate module progress

The existing Go package/module contracts remain the reference. These are
candidate implementation units, not additions to the public language.

## Owned declaration and type graph

`module_catalog.fy` records declarations by source-set module index and original
declaration index. Structs, resources, and enums share lookup rules with functions;
public visibility is checked for every qualified lookup. An alias changes the
lookup path, never the declaration identity. Module/import/name collisions and
missing providers fail before a catalog is published. The owner retains exact
source bytes and rejects resolution against a different source set.

`module_types.fy` interns nominal leaves by their exact module/declaration pair.
Option/Result and shared/mutable reference descriptors refer to canonical child
IDs. Existing scalar, C-scalar, raw-pointer, text, and byte-view descriptors remain
distinct. Failed resolution rolls back all speculative nodes. Graph publication
checks nominal coordinates and rejects forward/cyclic child references.

Construction uses separate local buffers/vectors and whole-resource publication;
it does not introduce mutable access to private resource fields. Bounds remain
32 modules, 32768 source bytes per module, 4096 descriptors, and depth 64.
These IDs belong only to the current source-set graph; package-instance identity,
persistent artifacts, and imported layout publication remain subsequent work.

The native dev/release API test executes the Fairy parser, catalog, and resolver
on real source fixtures. It covers equal file-local declaration numbers in
different modules, multiple aliases to one provider, private types, duplicate and
missing imports, wrong source-set inputs, rollback, and forged graph publication.
Evidence: `evidence/candidate-module-type-graph-20261008.json`.

This unit does **not** complete nominal multi-file body typing, HIR/MIR linking,
SDK admission, or native compilation of a multi-file user program. The older
scalar-only module CLI remains closed until those consumers can own the same
type and layout graph. Linux execution is deferred to the combined phase.

## Owned callable signatures

`module_signatures.fy` resolves provider and caller annotations into the same
canonical type graph, including nominal/resource/enum leaves, Option/Result,
references, C scalars, and the exact pointer output slot. The published owner
retains result/parameter IDs, module/declaration coordinates, public visibility,
effects, unsafe, must-use, and exact C linker bytes after the parser owners leave
scope. Conflicting C alias prototypes are rejected across modules; identical
prototypes retain their shared linker name.

Invalid declaration effects/must-use, private type imports, and void parameters
fail before publication. Generic signatures, receivers, body checking, and SDK
authentication remain outside this unit. Signature success is not a whole-program
check result. Evidence: `evidence/candidate-module-signatures-20261008.json`,
with actual Fairy dev/release native API execution.

## Owned AST composition

`module_ast_join.fy` copies parser-owned arenas into one source-set arena.
Original source bytes remain exact with a single newline between files; names
are not substituted and the concatenation is not reparsed. Expression, statement,
type, field, entry and attribute links shift by their own arena bases. Token
indices are mapped through their original byte positions, including trivia that
merges at the separator. `syntax.fy` exposes token facts and module-position
queries for these consumers.

The focused native test checks every source span against the original owners,
plus call arguments, literal cooking, assignment operators, query tokens,
tagged captures, switch and if bodies, for headers, cleanup receivers and enum
payload fields. Empty, generic and over-count inputs fail before publication.
Evidence: `evidence/candidate-module-join-20261008.json`.

This arena is bounded to 32 files and 32768 combined source bytes, 512
declarations, 4096 expressions/types/attributes/arguments, 8192 statements and
1024 entries/fields. Generic expansion, source-set binding and program lowering
are separate consumers; AST composition alone does not claim their completion.

## Nominal program consumers

`module_bind.fy` resolves named annotations and qualified expression uses through
the owned declaration catalog, then translates each exact module/declaration
coordinate to a unique declaration slot in the joined arena. Its input must
match both the signature owner's retained source set and the joined source bytes.
Aliases retain the same slot; identical names from different modules retain
different slots. These slots are transient program-owned identities, not stable
package IDs or persisted interface keys.

`module_program.fy` composes signature publication, AST join, binding, ordinary
name and type checking, owned HIR lowering, and MIR lowering. Name lookup and
duplicate checks stay within the source module. Bound nominal leaves flow into
borrow, tagged and array type consumers. Cross-module resource field access and
direct resource construction reject with private candidate code 6201; factories
and provider-owned borrowed access remain available. Callable effects, unsafe and
must-use are checked against the actual provider declarations.

The focused native API test renders verified C for imported structs/resources/
enums, aliases and duplicate helper names, and rejects mismatched nominal types,
private calls/representation, missing permissions, ignored must-use, and an
invalid provider with its original file-local position. It also rejects stale
signature inputs. Evidence: `evidence/candidate-module-program-20261008.json`.

This private API currently reuses one joined HIR/MIR owner (module number zero,
unique joined declaration numbers). The catalog-to-arena mapping is owned during
compilation; persistent package identity and per-file debug maps are not claimed.
The combined source/global-name limits remain 32768 bytes/128 globals. SDK,
generic and receiver admission, imported return-origin generalization, CLI
program output and actual execution of the emitted multi-file C remain separate
work. The existing scalar-only `--check-modules-file` command is unchanged.
